#Unfinished project! Still in the works!

# Amazon Clone

This is a clone of the Amazon webpage. It utilizes Javascript, HTML, and CSS. There
are multiple different pages including the main Amazon page, a checkout page, an
orders page, and a tracking page.

### Installing

To download the program, simply install all of the files in the repository.

### Executing program

To deploy as a web app, you can use a website hosting service, such as GitHub pages.
A link to the web service is on my GitHub as well!

## Acknowledgments
